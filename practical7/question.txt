question:  How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain? 
the line number: 51-62
At the begining of the coronavirus outbreak, the numbers of new cases and total cases in spain rised slowly. But after 2020/3/8, there was sharp increase of the new cases and total cases. 
The reason is that the spread of virus takes time. There will not be many cases at the beginning, but the cases will increase rapidly after some time. 
At the end of the plot (on 2020/3/29), we can see there is a little decrease of the number of the new cases. 
The reason might indicate the initial result of the control of the epidemic by spain government.
